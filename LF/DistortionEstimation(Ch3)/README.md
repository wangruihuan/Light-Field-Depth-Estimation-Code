This program estimates and compensates for depth distortion.

- Images should have name such as 'view_row_col.png' where row and col denotes angular coordinates of light field.
- Please adjust parameters in 'main_estimation.m' for your light field images. (Especially, threshold value for gradient)



Please send an e-mail for any question for this program.
Thank you.
