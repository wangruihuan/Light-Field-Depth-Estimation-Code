Laplacian Pyramid Toolbox (version 1.0, June 2004)
http://www.ifp.uiuc.edu/~minhdo/software/

This toolbox contains Matlab files that implement the Laplacian pyramid (LP) 
decomposition and the new reconstruction method in [1].

The main functions are LPD and LPR for LP decomposition and reconstruction,
respectively.  The script LPDEMO provides an example on how to use the
main functions in the toolbox.

Features:
+ Can handle signals of any dimension
+ Contain several popular pyramid filters such as '9/7', '5/3' and the 
  original 'Burt' filters
+ Have border handling
 
Limitation:
- Only work with signal size of power of 2
