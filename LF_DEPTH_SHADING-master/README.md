Source code used in the following paper.
Tao M W, Srinivasan P P, Malik J, et al. [Depth from shading, defocus, and correspondence using light-field angular coherence[C]](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/normals_PAMI.pdf) in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2015: 1940-1948.

This package contains the following:

**I.  depth_regularization.m**: estimates initial depth of a Lytro LF Image with defocus and Correspondence   
**II.  depth_regularization_shading.m**: estimates final depth of a Lytro LF Image with defocus and Correspondence and shading  
**III. input** : input image  
**IV. output:** output result  
**go.m** is an example for compute_LFdepth.m
